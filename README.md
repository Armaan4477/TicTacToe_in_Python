# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using PyQt6. The game supports both single-player (player vs bot) and two-player (player vs player) modes. The application is divided into three main parts: pregame, game, and postgame, each managed in separate files for better organization.

## Features

- Single-player mode (player vs bot)
- Two-player mode (player vs player)
- Score tracking for both players
- User-friendly interface with PyQt6
- Dynamic screens for start, game, and results
